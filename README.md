## üöÄ How to Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/visual-attendance-analytics.git
cd visual-attendance-analytics
```

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
pip install matplotlib
pip install pickle-mixin
```

Or install from requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Prepare Student Images

1. Create folders in the `Images/` directory with student roll numbers as folder names
2. Add 50-100 clear face images of each student in their respective folders
3. Ensure images are in JPG or PNG format
4. Images should have good lighting and clear face visibility

### Step 4: Train the Face Recognition Model

```bash
python face_recognition.py
```

This will:
- Process all images in the Images directory
- Create face encodings for each student
- Generate `trainner.yml` (trained model) and `labels.pickle` (label mappings)

### Step 5: Setup Attendance Database

Ensure the `TE2.csv` file contains the correct student information with the following columns:
- Sr. No., PRN, Status, Roll No., Name
- Subject columns: TOC, DBMS, SEPM, ISEE, CN, SDL
- Lecture count columns: TOC_LEC, DBMS_LEC, etc.
- Percentage columns: TOC%, DBMS%, etc.
- Status columns: TOC_STAT, DBMS_STAT, etc.

### Step 6: Run the Application

```bash
python test.py
```
